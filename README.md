# Eltex-Embedded-C

A repository for containing homework tasks from Eltex Academy

Each homework directory contains a Makefile with following options:
- `make all` or `make` to compile a binary
- `make clean` to clean directory from files derived by compilation
- `make rebuild` to clean a directory and then compile a binary
